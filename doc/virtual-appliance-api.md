Virtual Appliance API
*Also known as the "back-end API"*

This is meant to be a RESTful API, and authentication / encryption handled via
bi-directional certificate verification.

Please note that all API commands are meant to be run synchronously-- meaning
no single command should take more than about 10 seconds to return a status to
the controller.
