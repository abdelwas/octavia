# TODO

## import back-end api documentation from BLBv2, update as necessary to support

## Document image deployment methodology, including role 'controller' plays

## Decide whether to use openstack/diskimage-builder or some other tool for creating appliance image

## Port BLBv2 scripts to python within context of bare-bones ubuntu image. Add additional functionality to address API changes as detailed above.

## Once image can be reliably deployed, work on Neutron LBaaS driver which incorporates virtual appliance
