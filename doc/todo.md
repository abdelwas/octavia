# TODO

## import back-end api documentation from BLBv2
* Update as necessary to support topology configuration
* Update as necessary to fix non-api like features of old api

## Document image deployment methodology, including role 'controller' plays

## Document (with diagrams) topology options

## Decide whether to use openstack/diskimage-builder or some other tool for creating appliance image

## Port BLBv2 scripts to python within context of bare-bones ubuntu image. Add additional functionality to address API changes as detailed above.

## Once image can be reliably deployed, work on Neutron LBaaS driver which incorporates virtual appliance
